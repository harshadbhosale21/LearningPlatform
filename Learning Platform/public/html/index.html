            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
                education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and
                local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and
                Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to
                children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in
                India. Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as improving access and quality,
                reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing enrolment and completion rates, enhancing learning
                outcomes and employability, strengthening governance and accountability, promoting innovation and
                technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or
                preceptor after initiation. The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between
                the Guru and his Shishya (students /disciples) was a very important part of education. Takshasila
                (in modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher learning institute in India from
                possibly 8th century BCE, however, it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in
                modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges,
                and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a Taxila,
                in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system
                of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in the Pali
                language.

                Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These institutions imparted practical
                education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period
                between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centers of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar)
                and Manassa in Nagpur, among others.[citation needed] These institutions systematically imparted
                knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study topics such as Buddhist P치li literature,
                logic, p치li grammar, etc. Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated
                with founding of Mauryan Empire.
